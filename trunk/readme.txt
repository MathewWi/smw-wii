This is a port of Super Mario War to the Wii, using SDL Wii 
(http://code.google.com/p/sdl-wii/). It should be fully functional (with the 
exception of netplay - which requires someone (hint) to port SDL_Net). To make
this port possible, I've had to rewrite significant portions of [[SDL Wii]], 
particularly a complete re-write of the file, video, and sound systems. 
However, I'm hoping this work will encourage other developers to port more 
SDL-based games and applications to the Wii.


Usage

Copy the apps/ and smw/ folders to the root of your SD card.
